# Little script to measure how wait_readable scales with the number of
# sockets. We look at three key measurements:
#
# - cost of issuing wait_readable
# - cost of running the scheduler, while wait_readables are blocked in the
#   background
# - cost of cancelling wait_readable
#
# On Linux and macOS, these all appear to be ~O(1), as we'd expect.
#
# On Windows: with the old 'select'-based loop, the cost of scheduling grew
# with the number of outstanding sockets, which was bad.
#
# With the new IOCP-based loop, the cost of scheduling is constant, which is
# good. But, we find that the cost of cancelling a single wait_readable
# appears to grow like O(n**2) or so in the number of outstanding
# wait_readables. This is bad -- it means that cancelling all of the
# outstanding operations here is something like O(n**3)! To avoid this, we
# should consider creating multiple AFD helper handles and distributing the
# AFD_POLL operations across them.
#
# To run this on Unix systems, you'll probably first have to run:
#
#   ulimit -n 31000
#
# or similar.

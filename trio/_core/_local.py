    """Task-local storage.

    Instances of this class have no particular attributes or methods. Instead,
    they serve as a blank slate to which you can add whatever attributes you
    like. Modifications made within one task will only be visible to that task
    â€“ with one exception: when you start a new task, then any
    :class:`TaskLocal` attributes that are visible in the task that called
    ``start`` or ``start_soon`` will be inherited by the child. This
    inheritance takes the form of a shallow copy: further changes in the
    parent will *not* affect the child, and changes in the child will not
    affect the parent. (If you're familiar with how environment variables are
    inherited across processes, then :class:`TaskLocal` inheritance is
    somewhat similar.)

    If you're familiar with :class:`threading.local`, then
    :class:`trio.TaskLocal` is very similar, except adapted to work with tasks
    instead of threads, and with the added feature that values are
    automatically inherited across tasks.

    When creating a :class:`TaskLocal` object, you can provide default values
    as keyword arguments::

       local = trio.TaskLocal(a=1)

       async def main():
           # The first time we access the TaskLocal object, the 'a' attribute
           # is already present:
           assert local.a == 1

    The default values are like the default values to functions: they're only
    evaluated once, when the object is created. So you shouldn't use mutable
    objects as defaults -- they'll be shared not just across tasks, but even
    across entirely unrelated runs! For example::

       # Don't do this!!
       local = trio.TaskLocal(a=[])

       async def main():
           assert local.a == []
           local.a.append(1)

       # First time, everything seems to work
       trio.run(main)

       # Second time, the assertion fails, because the first time modified
       # the list object.
       trio.run(main)

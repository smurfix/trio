Description: Async/await-native I/O library for humans and snake people
 The Trio project's goal is to produce a production-quality, permissively
 licensed async/await-native I/O library for Python. Like all async
 libraries, its main purpose is to help you write programs that do multiple
 things at the same time with parallelized I/O. A web spider that
 wants to fetch lots of pages in parallel, a web server that needs to
 juggle lots of downloads and websocket connections at the same time, a
 process supervisor monitoring multiple subprocesses... that sort of
 thing. Compared to other libraries, Trio attempts to distinguish
 itself with an obsessive focus on usability and correctness.
 Concurrency is complicated; we try to make it easy to get things right.
